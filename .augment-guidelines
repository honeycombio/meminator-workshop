This project is used to demonstrate how to improve OpenTelemetry output.
It has implementations of each service in multiple languages, so that people can learn about the one they're interested in.
When code is commented out, especially when marked 'INSTRUMENTATION', that is important instructional material. Do not delete these comments.

When something fails, we want to diagnose it. That's useful instructionally. Therefore, do not implement fallback behavior for connection failures etc. Instead, create useful error telemetry.
